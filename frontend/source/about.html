        <h1>About N-Gage</h1>
        <p>Software is meant to solve problems. Complicated software only multiplies them. That is why we built EngageBay.

            Most business automation software is klutzy, costly, hard to implement and harder to use. Even if you manage to set up multiple standalone point solutions for individual processes, there's little chance of them inter-communicating seamlessly.
            
            At EngageBay, we take the ease of use issue very seriously - so we developed an integrated marketing, sales and support friendly automation with a free CRM thrown in for good measure that'll make sure everybody in the organization is on the same page and moreover, they will love using it. And what is equally if not more amazing is that this costs much less than you'd imagine, so it won't burn a hole in your pocket. Moreover, even an absolutely non-technical individual can set it up in a matter of minutes.
            
            We are a young team of dynamic marketers, sales pros and development aces, led by a very inclusive and experienced leadership team who have already launched several other startups.
            
            Today, over 12,000 businesses use EngageBay to run their businesses. We are thankful for their trust in us.
            
            But this is just the beginning. Enjoy the journey with us!</p>
